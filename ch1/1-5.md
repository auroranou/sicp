## Exercise 1.5

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

---

Using applicative order evaluation, the interpreter will attempt to evaluate all of the arguments when the procedure is applied, so that `(test 0 (p))` becomes:

```
(if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))
```

This will result in an infinite loop because `(p)` is defined as `(p)`.

Using normal order evaluation, the interpreter will evaluate arguments as they are needed. Since the `if` clause `(= 0 0 )` is true, the first expression (`0`) is returned and the second expression is never evaluated, preventing the infinite loop.
