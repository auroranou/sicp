## 1.14

Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents.

What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

---

**Orders of growth**
O(n)

As the amount for which to find change grows, the amount of space required grows linearly

**Steps used**
When the kind of coin is 1 (denomination = 1), the number of ways to find change is `(2n + 1)`. `2n` because each step requires two calculations, corresponding to the two values that are summed in the `else` clause of `cc`. The first value will always be `(cc x 0)`, which evaluates to zero and terminates that branch of the tree. The `+ 1` refers to the final step.

When the kind of coin is 2 (denomination = 5), the number of steps required encompasses the previous subtree for kind-of-coin = 1. However, there are also the additional steps required for decrementing by 5 while the amount to be evaluated is greater than 0. Consequently the number of steps can be describe as O(n^2).

The worst case scenario, where kind-of-coin is 5, requires O(n^5) time.
