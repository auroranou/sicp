## Exercise 1.12

The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.

```
         1
       1   1
     1   2   1
   1   3   3   1
 1   4   6   4   1
       . . .
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.

1
1  1
1  2  1
1  3  3  1
1  4  6  4  1
1  5 10 10  5 1
1  6 15 20 15 6 1

if y > x => 0
if x or y = 1 => 1
```

```scm
(define (pascal x y)
  (cond ((> y x) 0)
        ((= x 1) 1)
        ((= y 1) 1)
        (else (+ (pascal (- x 1) (- y 1))
                 (pascal (- x 1) y)))))
```
