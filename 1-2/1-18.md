Rules of Russian peasant algorithm (from [here](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.peasant.html)):
- Write each number at the head of a column.
- Double the number in the first column, and halve the number in the second column.
  - If the number in the second column is odd, divide it by two and drop the remainder.
  - If the number in the second column is even, cross out that entire row.
  - Keep doubling, halving, and crossing out until the number in the second column is 1.
- Add up the remaining numbers in the first column. The total is the product of your original numbers.
