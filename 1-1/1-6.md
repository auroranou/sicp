## Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond`?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of `if`:

```
(define (new-if predicate 
                then-clause 
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square-root program:

```
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

---

`if` and `cond` are different types of procedures in that `if` is a special form that relies on normal order evaluation, whereas `cond` is a standard Lisp procedure that uses applicative order evaluation.

Using `if`, if a guess is good enough it is returned as the answer. If it's not, only then is the `sqrt-iter` function called again because only one condition is ever evaluated. 

Using `cond`, all of the arguments are evaluated at the outset, which can result in an infinite loop in the second condition because the `else` clause will always be evaluated. This is similar to what happens in exercise 1.5.
