## Exercise 1.7

The `good-enough?` test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. 

---

For small numbers, the precision gap eventually becomes very wide. For instance `(sqrt 0.01)` returns a value of 0.10032578510960605 instead of 0.1, `(sqrt 0.0001)` returns a value of 0.03230844833048122 instead of 0.01, and it only gets worse from there.

For very large numbers, calling `sqrt` causes the program to seemingly freeze. I think what's happening is that the program is caught in an infinite loop because `good-enough?` returns false, causing `sqrt-iter` to be called again.

It returns false because improving the guess by averaging it with the target number `x` yields a difference less than 0.001.

---

An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough?` is to watch how `guess` changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a `square-root` procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?

```scm
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< 
    (abs (- (square guess) x ))
    (* guess 0.001)))
```
